# Commerce üè¨:

**Project 2 of the CS50 Web Development Course with Python and JavaScript**

## Task üíª:

**Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post
auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add
listings to a ‚Äúwatchlist.‚Äù**

## Specification üìù:

* **Models:** The application should have at least three models in addition to the User model: one for auction listings, one for bids, and one for
comments made on auction listings. It‚Äôs up to you to decide what elds each model should have, and what the types of those elds should be. Additional models
can be added.
* **Create Listing:** Users should be able to visit a page to create a new listing. They should be able to specify a title for the listing, a text-based
description, and what the starting bid should be. Users should also optionally be able to provide a URL for an image for the listing and/or a
category (e.g. Fashion, Toys, Electronics, Home, etc.)
* **Active Listings page:** The default route of your web application should let users view all of the currently active auction listings. For each active
listing, this page should display (at minimum) the title, description, current price, and photo (if one exists for the listing).
* **Listing page:** Clicking on a listing should take users to a page specic to that listing. On that page, users should be able to view all details about
the listing, including the current price for the listing.
  * If the user is signed in, the user should be able to add the item to their ‚ÄúWatchlist.‚Äù If the item is already on the watchlist, the user should be able
to remove it.
  * If the user is signed in, the user should be able to bid on the item. The bid must be at least as large as the starting bid, and must be greater than any
other bids that have been placed (if any). If the bid doesn‚Äôt meet those criteria, the user should be presented with an error.
  * If the user is signed in and is the one who created the listing, the user should have the ability to ‚Äúclose‚Äù the auction from this page, which makes
the highest bidder the winner of the auction and makes the listing no longer active.
  * If a user is signed in on a closed listing page, and the user has won that auction, the page should say so.
  * Users who are signed in should be able to add comments to the listing page. The listing page should display all comments that have been made
on the listing.
* **Watchlist:** Users who are signed in should be able to visit a Watchlist page, which should display all of the listings that a user has added to their
watchlist. Clicking on any of those listings should take the user to that listing‚Äôs page.
* **Categories:** Users who are signed in should be able to visit a Watchlist page, which should display all of the listings that a user has added to their
watchlist. Clicking on any of those listings should take the user to that listing‚Äôs page.
* **Django Admin Interface:** Via the Django admin interface, a site administrator should be able to view, add, edit, and delete any listings,
comments, and bids made on the site.
